  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>Aromatic | Creamy | Tangy</p>
  <p>
    Introduce a whole new flavour-space to the pi単a colada by adding an African twist to the classic coconut-pineapple
    pairing.
  </p>
  <p>Bless the rains in Africa that water the marula fruit tree and make this variation of the pi単a colada a possibility!</p>
  <p>
    Marula cream liqueur is a game changer for this cocktail. By itself, it is packed with a complex blend of flavours,
    having an overall sweet taste but with predominating tones of vanilla, citrus and toasted hazelnut. The texture, equally 
    complex, is smooth and categorically creamy, but light enough not to be overpowering or leave your mouth feeling coated
    and heavy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Marula cream, bold and complex as it is, doesn't always play nice with other drinks. In this cocktail, however, it is right
    at home! The citrusy flavour joins the pineapple in presenting a refreshing fruity taste. The earthier tones of vanilla and
    hazelnut ground the sweetness and pair perfectly with the coconut and rum. The light creamy texture fits with the typical
    creaminess of a colada without becoming overbearing. You can't help thinking this is how a pi単a colada always should have
    been.

  <p>
    So if you like pi単a coladas ... then this will be an instant hit. Grab a glass and escape!

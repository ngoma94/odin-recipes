  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>Daring | Spicy | Fruity</p>
  <p>Not for the faint of mouth</p>
  <p>
    This cocktail has no ties with any famous martial artist, but if you're caught off-guard,
    and you have low tolerance for spicy heat, you may find yourself reeling like you have been
    hit by its slightly more violent namesake.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, if you appreciate a little bit of spice, or you are looking for a unique gustatory experience,
    then consider treating yourself to a piquant, yet refreshing, One-Inch Punch.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Punch combines the sweetness of pineapple with the heat of chili peppers, in an unconventional marriage of
    flavour that can be both perplexing and oddly addictive. Your taste buds are first greeted by the fresh
    fruity taste. The pineapple is cool and sweet. Next, the chili starts to radiate heat. Initially, it is only subtle,
    but the coolness gradually fades. Almost all at once, you feel the spice all around your mouth and throat. It is not
    greatly discomforting, but it is enough to make you crave another sip to restore the sweet freshness you felt at the start. 
  </p>
  <p> So the cycle continues until you reach the end of your glass (and perhaps start another &#128521;).</p>
